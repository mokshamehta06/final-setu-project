# 🔒 Seized Goods Access & Transparency Platform

A secure bridge connecting government-authorized agencies with consumers for transparent resale of legally seized items at affordable, fixed prices.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This platform solves the accessibility gap between government-authorized agencies and end consumers by facilitating the direct sale of legally seized electronic goods. These valuable items—confiscated during customs checks, fraud investigations, or legal raids—are typically auctioned to verified agencies but rarely reach individual consumers. Our solution eliminates trust barriers, ensures complete legal transparency, and provides easy access to quality electronics at fixed prices without auction complexities.

## 🌱 Environmental Impact

When agencies fail to resell auctioned electronics, these items often become e-waste. Our platform reduces environmental impact by creating a secondary market that connects these otherwise discarded electronics with verified customers, extending product lifecycles and reducing electronic waste.
